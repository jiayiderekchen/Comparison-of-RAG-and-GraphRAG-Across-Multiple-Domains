# Comparative Analysis of RAG and GraphRAG Retrievers for Knowledge Retrieval in Diverse Datasets

## Motivation 
This study presents a comparative analysis of retriever part of traditional Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) system, and GraphRAG, a graph-enhanced RAG approach. By leveraging datasets across multiple domains, including SQuAD, PubMedQA, and arXiv, the research evaluates retrieval quality, efficiency, and the impact of graph structures on performance.

## Design of RAG and GraphRAG

## Conclusion 
The findings suggest that the choice between BaseRAG and GraphRAG depends on the applicationâ€™s domain and requirements. For tasks involving complex relationships and smaller datasets, GraphRAG is a promising choice. Conversely, BaseRAG remains the preferred option for general or large-scale applications.
